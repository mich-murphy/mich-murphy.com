I'm Michael Murphy, a full time Data Engineer and part time Linux enthusiast. I've put this blog together to document all of the personal projects I work on, which I would otherwise undoubtedly forget.

## Highlighted Projects

- [Nix Config](https://github.com/mich-murphy/nix-config): My personal MacOS configuration automated using Nix
- [i3 Dotfiles](https://github.com/mich-murphy/i3-dotfiles): My Arch Linux dotfiles including automated deployment using Ansible
- [DWM Doftiles](https://github.com/mich-murphy/dwm-dotfiles): Same as above only with DWM as my window manager instead of i3
- [This Website](https://github.com/mich-murphy/micha.elmurphy.com): Zola static website built using Nix and deployed via Github
