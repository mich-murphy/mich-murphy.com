# My Personal Website - [micha.elmurphy.com](https://micha.elmurphy.com/)

## Purpose
Created to document my personal projects, for my own reference and hopefully to help anyone else working on similar things.

## Components
This is a static site built using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/). I've setup a development environment and GitHub action to build and deploy the website using [Nix](https://nixos.org/). I'm using the Zola theme [terminimal](https://www.getzola.org/themes/zola-theme-terminimal/), which I've extended and customised. The site is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

## Special Thanks
The idea of using Nix, as well as the build and deploy actions were heavily inspired by [jdisaacs.com](https://github.com/jordanisaacs/jdisaacs.com).
